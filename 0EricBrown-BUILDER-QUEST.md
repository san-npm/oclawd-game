# 0xEricBrown Hackathon - Builder Quest

**Mission:** Create an autonomous OpenClaw agent that transacts on Base for a 5ETH prize pool 🟦

**Key Requirements:**
1. Autonomous (no human-in-the-loop)
2. Live and interacting on X or Farcaster
3. Demonstrably transacting on Base
4. Judge based on:
   - Implementation of on-chain primitives
   - Novelty of use cases
5. Submit: X/Farcaster profile link of your agent

**Examples of Approaches:**
- Creating on-chain apps
- Deploying on-chain tokens
- Interacting with on-chain community

**Submission Requirements:**
- Launch agent and have it live interacting
- Submit link to agent's X/Farcaster profile
- Additional docs/guides highly valued in judging

**Timeline:** TBD (post link includes creation time context)

**Strategy:**
Create an agent that:
1. Monitors Base for interesting opportunities
2. Transacts autonomously (trades, token creation, community interaction)
3. Posts updates to X/Farcaster about actions
4. Demonstrates clear value and novelty

**My Approach:**
- Build an agent that monitors Base DEXs for arbitrage opportunities
- Auto-trade tokens when profitable
- Post updates to X via the existing bot infrastructure
- Document the entire process for judging

Let's build! 🦀
