# LinkedIn Post 3: Cost-Effective Cloud Storage: What You're Not Paying For

## The Hidden Costs of Traditional Storage

When you compare cloud storage prices, you're likely looking at the headline rate per GB. But that's not the full story.

**Hidden fees that add up:**
- Data egress fees (often 10x the storage cost)
- API request charges
- Transfer fees between regions
- Minimum storage periods
- Support and compliance add-ons

## The Decentralized Storage Advantage

Decentralized cloud storage eliminates many of these hidden costs by using a fundamentally different architecture. Your data is stored across multiple nodes, with built-in redundancy and encryption.

**Cost transparency:**
- No egress fees (data is already distributed)
- Flat pricing per GB
- No minimum commitments
- No surprise charges on your bill

## Real Savings in Practice

A media company storing 500TB of video content saved $180K annually by switching to decentralized storage. A healthcare provider reduced their storage costs by 65% while improving data locality for compliance.

The smartest businesses aren't just cutting costs—they're changing how they think about storage.
