# OpenClaw + Aleph Cloud: The Perfect Stack for Autonomous AI

**TL;DR:** OpenClaw provides the agent orchestration, Aleph Cloud provides the decentralized infrastructure. Together, they're unstoppable.

---

## The Missing Piece in AI Agent Development

Building AI agents is hard. Deploying them at scale is harder. Most AI agent projects fail because they don't have the right infrastructure.

You've got:
- Agent logic (great)
- Data sources (great)
- APIs to integrate (great)

But you're missing:
- Where to run the agent 24/7
- How to scale automatically
- How to avoid vendor lock-in
- How to keep costs predictable

---

## Enter OpenClaw + Aleph Cloud

### OpenClaw: Agent Orchestration Layer
OpenClaw is an open-source framework for building and managing AI agents. It handles:

- Agent lifecycle (start, stop, restart)
- Tool integrations (web, messaging, APIs)
- Session management
- Memory and context
- Background task execution

### Aleph Cloud: Decentralized Infrastructure Layer
Aleph Cloud provides the decentralized computing infrastructure. It handles:

- Global compute network
- Automatic scaling
- No vendor lock-in
- Predictable pricing
- Global compliance

Together, they cover everything you need.

└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**The flow:**
1. OpenClaw manages your agent's logic and workflows
2. When your agent needs compute, OpenClaw calls Aleph Cloud
3. Aleph Cloud spins up the required resources on its decentralized network
4. Your agent runs, scales, and operates 24/7 without you thinking about infrastructure

---

## Real-World Example: Automated Trading Agent

Let's say you're building an AI agent that trades crypto automatically.

**With OpenClaw alone:**
- Your agent logic is solid
- You've integrated exchange APIs
- You've built a trading strategy

**But you need:**
- Where to run it 24/7
- How to scale when markets are volatile
- How to avoid AWS/GCP lock-in
- How to keep costs predictable

**With OpenClaw + Aleph Cloud:**
1. OpenClaw manages your agent's trading logic
2. Aleph Cloud provides the compute to run it 24/7
3. When markets go wild, Aleph Cloud scales automatically
4. Your agent keeps trading, no infrastructure headaches

---

## Why This Combination Wins

### 1. No Vendor Lock-in
Traditional cloud providers lock you in. Aleph Cloud is decentralized—you can move between providers without rewriting code.

### 2. Automatic Scaling
Your AI agent shouldn't worry about infrastructure. Aleph Cloud handles scaling automatically based on workload.

### 3. Open Source
OpenClaw is open source. You're not locked into a proprietary platform. You can modify, fork, and contribute.

### 4. Built for Agents
This isn't "general-purpose cloud with agent support." This is infrastructure built specifically for autonomous AI agents.

### 5. Predictable Costs
No surprise bills. You know what you're paying, and your agent can operate within budget constraints.

## Getting Started

Deploy your first OpenClaw agent on Aleph Cloud:

### 1. Install OpenClaw
```bash
npm install -g openclaw
```

### 2. Create Your Agent
```bash
openclaw agents create my-agent
```

### 3. Configure Aleph Cloud
Add Aleph Cloud to your agent's configuration:
```yaml
infrastructure:
  provider: aleph-cloud
  network: decentralized
  auto_scale: true
```

### 4. Deploy
```bash
openclaw agents deploy my-agent
```

Your agent is now running on Aleph Cloud's decentralized network, automatically scaling, 24/7.

## The Future of AI is Decentralized

The days of "AI agents running on AWS" are ending. The future is:
- Decentralized infrastructure
- Open-source orchestration
- Automatic scaling
- No vendor lock-in

OpenClaw + Aleph Cloud is that future, today.
