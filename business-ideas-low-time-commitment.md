## 💡 Core European Mindset

### What Europeans Value:
- **Expertise over hype** - You're a specialist, not a generalist
- **Quality results** - Deliver what you promise
- **Fair pricing** - Transparent, reasonable costs
- **Trust & relationships** - Long-term clients, not one-off gigs
- **Efficiency** - Respect their time, deliver quickly
- **Personal attention** - Tailored solutions, not cookie-cutter
- **Cultural sensitivity** - Understand local context
- **Work-life balance** - Services that save time, not create more work

### Pricing Reality Check:
- Europeans expect €50-150/hour for specialized work
- Project-based pricing preferred over hourly
- Value-based pricing (results, not time)
- No "get rich quick" schemes
- Long-term relationships > one-off sales
