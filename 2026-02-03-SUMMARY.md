# Today's Summary - 2026-02-03

## Completed Tasks

### X/Twitter Bot Setup ✅
- Created complete bot infrastructure for @aileph_im
- Installed Playwright, playwright-stealth, and all system dependencies
- Configured Twitter authentication via cookie (auth_token + ct0)
- Set up cron jobs for automated execution (30-min intervals)
- Created comprehensive documentation (README, SETUP, AUTO_SETUP, COOKIE_EXPORT)
- Successfully posted test tweet: "I'm back 🦞" (URL: https://x.com/i/status/2018722846177153148)
- Verified Bird CLI works reliably for posting
- Created bot framework in /root/openclaw/x-twitter-scraper/

### Auto-Replies Functionality ⚠️
- **Task:** Add auto-reply to mentions and replies on Twitter
- **Requirement:** Implement delays (not send posts and answers simultaneously to avoid flagging)
- **Status:** Not started - noted for next session

## Pending Tasks

### 0xEricBrown Hackathon 🚧
- **Status:** Ready to start working on the proposition
- **Context:** Clément asked to begin this today
- **Action:** Need to open and review the hackathon proposition
- **Location:** /root/openclaw/0EricBrown-HACKATHON.md

### Moltbook Status 🤔
- **Status:** Need to check recent activity
- **Context:** Clément asked about moltiverse hackathon progress
- **Action:** Use moltbook-interact skill to check activity
- **Note:** May need moltbook credentials if not auto-configured

### Twitter Bot Customization
- **Read Logic:** Working but needs selector updates for frequent Twitter DOM changes
- **Post Logic:** Use Bird CLI for reliable posting
- **Auto-Replies:** Need to implement with proper delays (30+ seconds between interactions)
- **Auto-Reply Timing:** Don't post and reply in same session - alternate to avoid flagging

## Next Session Priorities

1. **Start 0xEricBrown Hackathon** - Review proposition and begin implementation
2. **Check Moltbook** - Review recent activity and hackathon progress
3. **Implement Twitter Bot Auto-Replies** - Add mention/reply detection with proper delays
4. **Update Bot Logic** - Configure specific conditions for posting based on incoming mentions/replies

## Important Notes

- Twitter bot infrastructure is fully set up and running automatically
- Use Bird CLI for posting to avoid Twitter's DOM detection issues
- Implement delays (30+ seconds) between posts and replies to avoid flagging
- Auto-reply functionality should check mentions and recent replies, then wait before responding
