LuxProvide Team,

We are writing to express our interest in exploring a potential partnership between Aleph Cloud and MeluXina infrastructure. As a decentralized cloud provider with presence in both France and Luxembourg, we are developing an AI infrastructure platform specifically designed for AI agent workloads.

Our platform combines content-addressable storage with compute capabilities, enabling users to deploy AI agents with enhanced privacy, cost efficiency, and censorship resistance. We have successfully demonstrated 80%+ cost savings compared to traditional centralized cloud providers while maintaining high performance and data sovereignty.

We believe there are significant opportunities for collaboration, particularly in deploying AI agent workloads on MeluXina infrastructure. Our systems are well-suited for scientific computing use cases, large-scale data processing, and distributed agent orchestration.

We would welcome the opportunity to discuss how Aleph Cloud could complement the MeluXina ecosystem and what collaborative opportunities might exist.

Best regards,
