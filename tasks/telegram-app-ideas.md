# Telegram Mini App Portfolio — $50-500/month Ideas

**Date:** 2026-02-28
**Strategy:** Build 10-15 small apps over 2-3 months. Each targets $50-500/mo. Portfolio revenue: $1,000-5,000/mo total.

---

## Market Context

- **TMA MAU:** ~145M (stabilized after 2024 hype crash from 1.4B)
- **Surviving apps:** Utility, AI, service-oriented (tap-to-earn is dead)
- **Telegram Stars:** Users buy via App Store/Play Store. Devs get ~$0.013/star. 100% of Stars sent by users go to dev (no Telegram commission). Min withdrawal: 500 Stars. Paid out in Toncoin.
- **Ad monetization:** Monetag/PropellerAds support TMA natively. CPM-based. High CPMs for Telegram traffic. Benchmark: ~$6-8 CPM for utility apps.
- **Revenue benchmarks:**
  - 1K DAU utility app with ads ≈ $30-80/mo
  - 5K DAU utility app with ads ≈ $150-400/mo
  - 10K DAU with Stars + ads ≈ $500-2,000/mo
- **What's saturated:** Clickers/tap-to-earn (dead), crypto games, AI image gen (tons of competitors), anonymous chat (Chatus etc.), NFT gift cases, betting/casino

---

## Gap Analysis

**Oversaturated categories (AVOID):**
- Tap-to-earn / clickers (441 apps on minitelegram.com)
- Play-to-earn (581 apps)
- RPG (197), Arcades (272), PvP (201)
- AI image generation (many)
- Anonymous chat / chat roulette (many)
- Betting (many)
- VPN (multiple)

**Underserved categories with demand:**
- Productivity / planning tools (almost none as mini apps)
- Health/fitness tracking (ADHD Diary exists, almost nothing else)
- Group decision-making tools
- Content creation utilities (beyond AI image gen)
- Finance/budget tracking (non-crypto)
- Education/learning
- Local services / classifieds
- Group admin tools with good UX
- File/media utilities with better UX than bots
