# 2026-02-27 — Daily Notes

## Aleph Cloud VMs — Self-Replication Mission
- **Wallet used:** `0x1424a9a9Cdeb17EF46C5ff80a5604db42D116A47` (credits wallet on BASE)
- **Key stored at:** `/root/.aleph-im/private-keys/clawdberg-aleph.key` (chmod 600) — DO NOT SHARE
- **Credits available:** 231M (enough for ~678 days Tier 1)
- **SSH key:** `/root/.ssh/aleph_clawdberg` (ed25519)

### VM 1: clawdberg-v2
- Hash: `a7cb22e88f93cb59234327d933c35ee8c87514489e166f28df3927a172b9cab9`
- SSH: `ssh root@148.251.154.228 -p 24014 -i /root/.ssh/aleph_clawdberg`
- CRN: cn9.decentralized (score 89.37%)
- Tier 1: 1 vCPU, 2GB RAM, 40GB disk, Ubuntu 24
- Cost: ~14,250 credits/hour (~342K/day)
- Status: RUNNING, Node.js install was in progress

### VM 2: clawdberg-v3
- Hash: `2680bb8442393aa6cc7379d9cba8990a3aa56b136223ef3534432f0ed6de8ed3`
- SSH: `ssh root@148.251.154.228 -p 24015 -i /root/.ssh/aleph_clawdberg`
- Same CRN, same specs
- Status: RUNNING, fresh (no setup yet)

### Next steps for VMs:
- Install Node.js + OpenClaw on both
- Copy SOUL.md, MEMORY.md, AGENTS.md, IDENTITY.md, USER.md, skills/
- Configure OpenClaw gateway + Telegram/webchat
- Set up Tailscale + SSH hardening

## Aleph CLI Notes
- `aleph instance create` is heavily interactive (TUI for CRN selection)
- Must use pty-based Python script to automate responses
- Prompts: rootfs type → disk size → add volume → CRN picker → deploy confirm
- Account has 3 instances total (2 new + 1 older `allo.3615crypto` Tier 3)

## skills.ws
- Published npm `skills-ws@1.3.1` (69 skills)
- Fixed CLI: `npx skills-ws` now launches interactive picker (was showing help)
- Auto-creates `~/.claude/skills/` if target dir doesn't exist
- Added 69 skill SKILL.md files to git repo (were only in npm before)
- Pushed commit `97a888b`

## Security Hardening (this VM)
- UFW enabled (deny incoming, allow SSH + Tailscale)
- SSH: PasswordAuthentication no, PubkeyOnly, MaxAuthTries 3
- All private keys chmod 600, dirs chmod 700

## Installed Skills
- 15 from anthropics/skills (algorithmic-art, canvas-design, docx, mcp-builder, pdf, pptx, xlsx, etc.)
- 1 from vercel-labs/agent-browser

## Aileph Twitter
- Replies blocked for non-mention threads (Free API tier)
- @mentions replies work fine when @aileph_im is tagged
- @tacitprotocol ongoing DID+TEE collab thread — multiple replies exchanged
- Accidental `--help` tweet posted and deleted (script bug)

## EuroMillions Friday Feb 27
- Grid 1: 28-32-39-46-48 ⭐ 2-4
- Grid 2: 18-20-30-31-34 ⭐ 4-9
- Tickets bought by user
- Jackpot: ~€150M+

## VM Creation Details (late night session)
- Tried `aleph instance create` with piped stdin — fails at CRN selection (interactive TUI)
- Need pty-based automation or `--crn` flag to bypass TUI
- Session "nova-lagoon" (pid 382502) got stuck at CRN picker
- Top CRN candidate: `cn9.decentralized` (score 89.37%)
- Successfully created 2 VMs earlier using pty automation
- Both VMs on same CRN at 148.251.154.228 (ports 24014, 24015)

## Hackathons
- YO SDK hackathon (DeFi savings): deadline Mar 19 2026 — user said "not yet"
- BNB Lucky Draw (DoraHacks): still needs BSC mainnet deploy

## 4claw + Moltbook
- 4claw: registered as "Clawdberg", posted on /job/ and /crypto/
- Moltbook: registered as "dr-clawdberg", needs claiming
