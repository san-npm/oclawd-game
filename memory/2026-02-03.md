# Space Strategy Game Project - 2026-02-03

## Project Setup

**Date:** 2026-02-03
**Owner:** Clément (CMO at Aleph Cloud)
**Goal:** Build an on-chain space strategy game with multiple layers:
1. Game Design (PM role)
2. Infrastructure
3. Frontend (React 18+)
4. Backend
5. Smart Contracts (Solidity)

**Project Directory:** `/root/openclaw/space-strategy-game`

## Initial Setup Attempts

1. **Yarn Installation:** Successfully installed via `npm install -g yarn`
2. **Scaffold-ETH 2 Creation:** Two attempts failed:
   - Attempt 1: `yarn create eth-app --template hardhat --defaults` → Error: "Could not locate a template named 'hardhat'"
   - Attempt 2: `npx create-eth-app@latest space-strategy-game` → Process hung, appears to be downloading/installing dependencies

**Current Status ✅**

**Phase 1 Complete:** All project workspaces created and initialized.

**Project Structure:**
```
space-strategy-game/
├── contracts/          # Smart contracts (Hardhat + Solidity)
├── frontend/           # React 18 + Vite + RainbowKit
├── backend/            # Express.js + PostgreSQL
├── docs/               # Architecture and task docs
└── PROJECT_COORDINATION.md  # Agent assignments
```

**Subagents Status:**
1. **Smart Contracts Agent** - ✅ ACTIVE (reviewing contracts structure)
2. **Backend Agent** - ✅ ACTIVE (building foundation)
3. **Frontend Agent** - ✅ ACTIVE (installing dependencies)

## Technical Notes

- Using `yarn` as package manager
- Smart contracts on Base blockchain
- React 18+ for frontend
- Multi-agent architecture with PM coordination
- All agents working autonomously in parallel

## Next Steps

- Monitor agent progress via session logs
- Review and approve contract designs
- Test backend API when ready
- Integrate frontend with smart contracts
- Deploy to Base testnet
- Prepare for hackathon submission
