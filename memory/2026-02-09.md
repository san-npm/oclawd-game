## Frontend Mock Alert Issue (Late Night - ONGOING)
- User reported seeing "Raffle creation initiated! (Mock - integrate with smart contract)" alert
- Source code in `frontend/src/app/create/page.tsx` was already fixed (uses real `useCreateRaffle` hook)
- Issue: Stale `.next` build cache serving old code
- Fix attempted:
  - Removed `.next` directory (commit `39a8782`)
  - Fixed Next.js version conflict (eslint downgrade from 9.18.0 to 8.57.0 to match next@14.2.15)
  - Added missing dependencies (@react-native-async-storage/async-storage@^1.24.0, pino-pretty@^13.0.0) (commit `6a30643`)
  - Pushed fixes (commit `dcbec73`, `6a30643`)
- Root cause: Vercel deployment still serving old cached version
- Solution needed: Redeploy on Vercel Dashboard → click "Redeploy" button on `celottery-frontend` project
- Frontend repo location: `/tmp/celo-agent-raffle/frontend` (not in main workspace)
- **ONGOING ISSUE**: npm install keeps failing, node_modules not building properly
- **NEXT STEP**: Manual npm install with force/legacy-peer-deps, then rebuild

## Mock Alert Investigation (Feb 10)
- Confirmed mock alert was in commit `e91c709` (Initial commit): `alert('Raffle creation initiated! (Mock - integrate with smart contract)');`
- Mock alert was **already removed** in commit `e7e8a15` (Connect frontend to AgentRaffleV2)
- GitHub repo is clean — no mock alert in current source code
- **ACTUAL PROBLEM**: Vercel is deploying the wrong commit or wrong branch
- Latest commit on master: `6a30643` (HEAD)
- User confirmed they already cleared cache and redeployed on Vercel, but mock alert still shows
- **DIAGNOSIS**: Vercel project is connected to wrong commit, wrong branch, or auto-deploy isn't working
- **NEXT STEP**: Check Vercel live deployment commit hash and branch to identify mismatch
