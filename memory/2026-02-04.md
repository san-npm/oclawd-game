# Session Notes - 2026-02-04

## What I Worked On
1. **Uploaded files to Notion**
   - Successfully uploaded 13 markdown files to a Notion page under commitdao
   - Fixed script issues (version mismatches, JSON escaping problems)
   - Used chunked uploads (100 blocks per request)

2. **SSH Connection Issue**
   - User experiencing Permission Denied with SSH to `root@212.83.186.14 -p 24000`
   - Identified correct public key: `ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIMtDGUCsnWD6xQ1DMFa+G/i4Z4/iCNsuoMhUqNimXHsK`
   - Provided commands to add key manually to server's `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`

## Decisions Made
- Used Notion API with version `2025-09-03`
- Chunked uploads at 100 blocks per request (Notion API limit)
- Skipped `space-strategy-game/docs/` folder to avoid long processing times
- Uploaded all markdown files in `/root/openclaw/` to a single Notion parent page

## Leads Generated
- None (file upload task completed successfully)

## Blockers
- **SSH Connection:** User still getting `Permission denied (publickey)` after providing the correct key. May require server admin access to add key to `authorized_keys` file or use alternative authentication method.

## Next Steps
1. User may need to contact server admin to add SSH key
2. Alternative: Use server's web-based management panel (if available)
3. If successful, could continue work on server tasks from memory
