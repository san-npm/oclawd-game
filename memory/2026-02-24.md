## Liberclaw (Libertai/liberclaw)
- Repo: https://github.com/Libertai/liberclaw — Python monorepo, FastAPI + Expo
- Building skills for baal-agent (AI agents on Aleph Cloud)
- Existing: 24 skills, 14 templates, 3 categories (developer, productivity, web3)
- Skills deploy via deployer.py → _deploy_skills() → copies only SKILL.md to VM
- Built prompt-injection-defense skill: SKILL.md with embedded Python scanner code (agent writes to disk on first use), regex-based, 60+ patterns, 5 attack categories, inspired by lasso-security/claude-hooks
- Added to catalog.json (25 skills), wired to full-stack-dev, code-reviewer, personal-assistant, research-assistant templates
- Building 7 more skills (2 sub-agents running): token-analysis, wallet-forensics, defi-strategies, aleph-dev, web-security, smart-contract-security, nextjs-dev
- scanner.py also exists standalone at skills/prompt-injection-defense/scanner.py (won't deploy to VMs, just for reference)

## Aileph Twitter
- Morning run: 3 tweets (sovereign AI, node buying, Vitalik frontends)
- Afternoon run: 3 tweets (@MurtingJ SMEs, @Mrkt30news EU sovereignty, original on autonomous agents contradiction)
