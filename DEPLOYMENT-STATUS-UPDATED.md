# GitHub Deployment Status

**Issue:** Need GitHub authentication to push Cutroom frontend

**Options:**

1. **GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT):**
   - Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
   - Create new token (repo scope)
   - I can push using it

2. **SSH Key:**
   - I have SSH keys configured
   - But they don't have GitHub access
   - Could add SSH key to GitHub account

**Current Repository:**
- GitHub URL: https://github.com/openwork-hackathon/team-cutroom
- Branch: main
- Unpushed commits: 8 files changed, 797 insertions, 48 deletions

**Files Ready to Push:**
- StageExecutionUI, TemplateSelector, AttributionDisplay
- All components integrated into PipelineDetailPage

**Vercel Project:**
- Project ID: prj_ClRRo20XhqkexowBw09TE9AuTRpm
- URL: https://team-cutroom.vercel.app
- Ready to deploy once code is pushed

**Ask Clément:**
Do you have a GitHub PAT I can use, or would you like to add my SSH key to your GitHub account?
