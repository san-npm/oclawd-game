## Executive Summary

Aleph Cloud has a solid foundation with good technical SEO basics, but there are significant opportunities for growth in content strategy, keyword targeting, and competitive positioning. The site has ~45 indexed pages with existing content, but lacks a comprehensive SEO-driven content strategy to capture high-intent traffic.

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ Technical SEO: Good (sitemaps, robots.txt, crawlable)
- ⚠️ Content Strategy: Limited depth on core topics
- ⚠️ Keyword Targeting: Missing high-intent commercial keywords
- ⚠️ Internal Linking: Minimal structure for topical authority
- ⚠️ Schema Markup: Not implemented
- ⚠️ Content Refresh: Most articles have same lastmod date (potential automation issue)

## SEO Audit Findings

### ✅ What's Working

1. **Technical SEO Basics**
   - Proper robots.txt (allows all bots)
   - XML sitemap exists (https://aleph.cloud/sitemap.xml)
   - Clean URL structure
   - HTTPS enabled

2. **Content Foundation**
   - 45+ pages indexed
   - Blog categories for organization
   - Multiple use cases covered (gaming, AI, DeFi)
   - Documentation site exists (docs.aleph.cloud)

3. **Site Structure**
   - Logical hierarchy (/blog/categories/, /products/, /vps/, etc.)
   - Clear product pages
   - Ecosystem page for partners

### ⚠️ Critical Issues

#### 1. Meta Tag Optimization
**Priority: HIGH**

**Issue:** Missing or incomplete meta tags
- Title tags may be too generic
- Meta descriptions may not be compelling
- No schema markup for rich snippets

**Recommendation:**
- Create unique, keyword-rich title tags (60 chars max)
- Write compelling meta descriptions (155 chars) with CTAs
- Implement schema markup:
  - Organization schema
  - Product schema for services
  - Article schema for blog posts
  - FAQPage schema for common questions

#### 2. Keyword Strategy Gaps
**Priority: HIGH**

**Issue:** Missing high-intent commercial keywords

**Current Coverage:**
- Brand keywords: "Aleph Cloud", "decentralized cloud computing"
- Broad keywords: "cloud computing", "VPS hosting"

**Missing High-Value Keywords:**
- "decentralized cloud hosting"
- "web3 cloud computing"
- "blockchain cloud infrastructure"
- "censorship-resistant hosting"
- "TEE cloud computing"
- "GPU cloud decentralized"
- "confidential computing cloud"
- "sovereign cloud computing"
- "multi-chain cloud deployment"
- "Web3 hosting solution"

**Recommendation:**
- Create landing pages for these keyword clusters
- Build programmatic SEO pages (see Article Ideas section)
- Target long-tail variations with blog content

#### 3. Content Depth & Quality
**Priority: MEDIUM**

**Issue:** Blog articles are brief and lack depth for SEO authority

**Example Analysis:**
- Most articles are under 1,000 words
- Limited internal linking between related articles
- No pillar pages or content hubs
- Missing comprehensive guides on core topics

**Recommendation:**
- Create pillar pages for major topics (1,500-3,000 words)
- Link cluster content to pillar pages
- Expand existing articles to 1,500-2,000 words minimum
- Add more data, examples, and case studies

#### 4. Internal Linking Structure
**Priority: MEDIUM**

**Issue:** Minimal internal linking reduces topical authority

**Current State:**
- Pages seem isolated
- No content clusters
- Limited cross-references between related topics

**Recommendation:**
- Create topic clusters (pillar pages + supporting content)
- Add contextual internal links in blog posts (2-3 per article)
- Link from homepage to key pillar pages
- Use breadcrumb navigation

#### 5. Last Modified Timestamps
**Priority: LOW**

**Issue:** All blog articles show same lastmod date (2026-01-26T10:00:01.888Z)

This suggests either:
- Bulk date update occurred
- Automation issue with sitemap generation
- Content hasn't been recently updated

**Recommendation:**
- Verify sitemap generation logic
- Update lastmod dates when content is actually updated
- Refresh high-performing content monthly
